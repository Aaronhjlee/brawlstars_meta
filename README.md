## Motivation

In playing any strategy video game, it is crucial to be able to determine what is the best strategy to employ to reach the opjective. Compared to the biggest MOBA games out there, League of Legends, Dota 2, etc., there is not much analysis for mobile games. Everything from character usage, map selection, to team composition, there is only a small subset of the community that engages data to breakdown Supercell's newest game [BrawlStars](https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/).
